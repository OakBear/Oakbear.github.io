摸着石头过河才勉强能做到我预想的效果，即本地写markdown，push后网页更新

steps:

hugo on your windows (specified version)

hugo build the raw structure

submodule loveit

write your md in content folder

Configure the website appearance and settings in hugo.toml

prepare the .github\workflows\main.yml file

push

wait for github action

now you see me

没开评论区是一种遗憾，即使是最简单的文字回复,只有ip，也能凭借时间距离带来震撼

过往冲浪时，常常误入各种搜索引擎找得到或找不到只能凭借捡到的不知道谁发在什么地方的域名进入的各种个人网站，多为文集。一篇篇文章找过去，寻感兴趣的一篇篇打开，看着日期茫然(零几年的无图网站以及国外的上世纪网站)。有时能看见陌生人的生活，想法。其中有学生，但多为码农（2018年的码农）。我曾耳濡目染各种对过往十余年中国(移动)互联网迅猛发展时期的回忆，那供不应求的市场，想象着那郴州杭州加州的经历，再看到这一篇篇墓，或许这就是互联网拉近空间时间距离的感受吧。那些深夜发于情而敲下的文字，在1kb中等待着未来另一个人的点击。

In past wanderings across the web, I often drifted into all kinds of personal websites — ones that search engines could either locate or fail to locate, accessible only by some domain name I happened to pick up without knowing who had posted it or where. Most were collections of writings. I combed through them piece by piece, opening those that caught my attention, staring at the datestamps in bewilderment (sites from the 2000s without images, and even some from the last century abroad). At times, I could catch glimpses of the lives and thoughts of strangers. Some were students, but most were programmers — programmers of 2018.

I had once been immersed in recollections of the decade-long surge of China’s (mobile) internet boom, that era of demand far exceeding supply, imagining the crying in pale bedsheets at midnight. And then, seeing these pages again like tombs, perhaps this is what it means for the internet to collapse spatial distance, and temporal distance. Those words typed in the late hours under the pull of feeling lie dormant within 1kb, waiting for another person in the future to click them open.
